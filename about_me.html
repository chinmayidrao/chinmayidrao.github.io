                <h1>A bit more about me...</h1>
                <p>Hello and Welcome! I'm Chinmayi D Rao, a Pre-Final Year Student at NMAM Institute of Technology. I will graduate in the August of 2026 with a degree in Biotechnology. Originally hailing from Mangalore, I grew up with a love for the sunny skies, the coastal breeze and the default-Mangalorean love for Pabbas Ice-creams. I have two wonderful and supportive parents, who have partly been the reason why I chose Biotechnology as my Major. My mother, a lady with great passion for the sciences, studied Food science and Nutrition during her time at uni. Her previous experiences in the laboratory, and her research project reports played a huge role in making me develop an interest for the research field.</p>
                <p>I started studying at NMAMIT in 2022, and gained an amazing opportunity to grow and learn as an individual. Being a college student has taught me the value of maintaing a strict daily-schedule. As someone who's also very active with extra curriculars, I usually have a tight schedule. Despite this, I find the time to constantly learn new skills on a regular basis.</p>
                <p>As a Biotechnology student, I have found myself liking wet-lab projects more than dry-lab ones. However, I dont let this bias restrict me from learning dry-lab skills such as coding and computer-based analyses.</p>
                <h3>My motto in life: "Balance is the key to success: <br>Prioritize, Organize, and SHINE."</h3>
